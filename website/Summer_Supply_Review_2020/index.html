            <h1>Summer Supply Review 2020</h1>

            <section>
                <p>ENTSOG has completed the review of the European gas picture for Summer 2020, April to September. The seasonal Reviews aim at a deeper comprehension of the development of the demand and supply in the previous seasons and the identification of trends that cannot be captured at national or regional level.</p>
                <p>Summer Supply Reviews help to build experience and a solid background for the assumptions considered in the Summer Supply Outlook. Such knowledge is also factored in the recurrent TYNDP process in order to ensure a consistent improvement over ENTSOG reports, as well as in the ongoing R&D plan.</p>
                <p>The key findings of this review are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Widespread lockdown measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic across the EU deeply impacted the lifestyles, the economy and the energy markets since March of 2020 leading to the lowest European gas prices in the last 9 years.</li>
                    <li>Mild winter weather and some declines in consumption by industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures drove the seasonal gas demand in Europe to a decreased of 7% compared with previous summer, reaching 1,770TWh.</li>
                    <li>The storage level at the beginning of the summer 2020 was the highest (54%) of the last six summers reaching a 95% by the end of September. An oversupplied market, together with low gas prices and sesonal gas demand lead to a lower UGS utilization during the winter season.</li>
                    <li>A combination of the already mentioned factors has seen imports flows to Europe fall during summer 2020.</li>
                    <li>A falling domestic production in the Netherlands, Denmark and other European countries, led the European indigenous production (hereafter national production) to kept the decresing trend already observed inprevious summer season.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Detailed data for the cross-border flows is available on the Transparency Platform<span title="Transparency Platform: https://transparency.entsog.eu/"><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></span>.</p>
                <p>Stakeholders’ comments on this seasonal analysis are welcome and would enable ENTSOG to improve its knowledge of seasonal and market dynamics influencing the use of infrastructure. Comments would serve as basis for the R&D plan and be beneficial to the quality of further reports.</p>
                <p><i><u>Disclaimer:</u> the content of this Supply Review is subject to future changes, depending on the outcome of ENTSOG’s assessment of the EU/UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</i></p>

                <h3 id="1"><span class="chapter">1. </span> Introduction</h3>
                <p>This review, as part of the ENTSOG Annual Work Programme 2021, is published on a voluntary basis and aims at providing an overview of the demand and supply balance during summer 2020. The report brings transparency on the internal analysis carried out by ENTSOG for the purpose of developing the seasonal Supply Outlooks as well as the Union-wide TYNDP.</p>
                <p>The report aims to provide an overview of European trends that cannot be captured at national or regional level  and to build experience for future reports. This report should not be seen as a direct review of previous Seasonal Outlooks, as outlooks do not aim to provide a forecast but to better explore infrastructure resilience in view of actual past trends.</p>
                <p>Regarding European dynamics, the report highlights the wide heterogeneity of national demand profiles and supply sources. These differences are linked among others to physical rationales such as climate, demand breakdown or producing field flexibility for example.</p>

                <p>Different events on the European gas market caused fluctuations in the supply and demand balance from April to September 2020. The major ones were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Widespread lockdown measures related to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic across the EU deeply impacted the lifestyles, the economy and the energy markets in the second quarter of 2020 leading to the lowest European gas prices in the last 18<span title=" Source: Platts"><a href="#footnote2">[3]</a></span> years. Afterwards, European gas prices increaseed sharply from May lows, thanks to a firmer spot markets seen across Continental Europe in June,.</li>
                    <li>Gas demand decreased in general across Europe subdued by mild winter weather and some declines in consumption by industry due to the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures.</li>
                    <li>UGS utilisation was lower than the one from previous winters caused by a low winter demand and an oversupplied market.</li>
                    <li>A combination of the above mention factors have seen imports flows to Europe fall during summer 2020.</li>
                    <li>The pan-European LNG imports fell in September due to US shipment cancellations and a re-surge in Asian demand.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The following graphs show the evolution of gas prices in Europe during Summer 2020, as well as the overall monthly ranges and averages in comparison to those of 2019.</p>
                <p><strong>Figure 1</strong> displays the evolution of the month-ahead average prices for the different European gas hubs. The graph shows how the majority of the European hubs follow a similar trend by  reacting in the same direction, with rather no exceptions.</p>

                <p class="fig-caption">Figure 1. Month-ahead average price at EU Hubs.</p>
                <p>The European gas hubs reached the lowest European gas prices in the last 9 years (latest historical data registered in ENTSOG) driven by a gas demand slump caused by the declines in consumption by industry due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. From July the European gas prices increased sharply thanks to firmer spot markets seen across Continental Europe. September high prices reflect as well the European market’s reaction to the LNG imports reduction caused by US shipment cancellations and a re-surge of the Asian demand.</p>

                <p><strong>Figure 2</strong> compares the maximum range and average of the month-ahead summer price for the last two summers over all the European hubs. The average price over all hubs decreased significantly in 2020, showing lower prices levels when compared to the ones seen summer 2019. The price ranges were lower in all the season compared with 2019. The price convergence between the European hubs continued and were following similar price signal.</p>

From 2016 onwards the demand started to increase again until summer 2018, when a drop has been registered. Once again, a remarkable increased of demand (14%) has been obserded in summer 2019 followed by 7% decreased in summer 2020 driven by COVID-19 pandemic containment measures.</p>

The summer consumption decreased in the residential, commercial and industrial sector from summer 2019 to 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures.  On the other hand, the gas demand for power generation increased compared to summer 2019 mainly driven by the increased in some European countries because of competitive gas price and a potentialy coal to gas switch despite the fact that several countries experienced a decreased due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.</P>

                <p>Differing from previous summer trend, Norwegian pipeline gas supplies to Europe slightly fell in April and May due to a commercial turndown driven by low record  European gas prices, followed by a recovery in June and fell back in August compared with July, as planned summer maintenance activity began in earnest on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. In September, Nowegian imports show a remarkable increase driven by the fall in LNG  imports in September due to US shipment cancellations and a re-surge in Asian demand (as observed in LNG supply graph). Rusian gas supply to Europe increased along the summer month with a decreased in due to annual maintenance shutdowns on both the Nord Stream and Yamal-Europe lines during July. Additionally, LNG supply to Europe decreased along the summer months caused by a low demand and the re-surge in Asian demand as of September and US shipment cancelations.</p>

                <p>The evolution of the injection season depends on many factors, in particular the willingness of shippers to inject gas and the actual amount of gas available for injection after the gas demand is satisfied. The first factor may be linked to price signals such as summer/winter spread, unless the national regulatory framework implies some mandatory injection, and the second one is linked to climatic and economic considerations. <strong>Figure 23</strong> shows UGS injection and withdraw profile of European storages.</p>

                <p>The overall transported gas at the EU aggregated level is the sum of gas demand, exports and injection for each month.</p>
                <img class="center-image image-clickable" src="image045.jpg">
                <p class="fig-caption">Figure 26. Transported gas.</p>
                <p>As observed in <strong>Figure 26</strong>, the total transported gas during Summer 2020 (2,432TWh) was 9% lower in comparison with previous summer season (2,665TWh). Demand plus exports, and UGS injection were lower among the season than the ones from the previous summer. The lower transported gas is mainly driven by a higher level of the storages at the beginning of the summer season. The very mild winter 2019/2020, combined with an over-supplied market of pipeline gas and LNG and low gas prices, had an impact on the UGS utilisation. Additionally, the measures taken across Europe to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic hit the summer demand  from mid-March.</p>
